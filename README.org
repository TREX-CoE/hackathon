* Presentation

Making HPC software easy to install on multiple supercomputers or
different architectures is a difficult task: different systems have
different compilers, libraries, system commands etc. This task can be
helped by tools like [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/][GNU Autotools]].

In this Hackathon, we will help code developers better understand
how to use these build systems to improve the portability of their
applications. In addition, well-done configuration scripts facilitate
the packaging of the software, and presentations will be given to
propose different packaging possibilities to distribute the software.

This Hackathon is a multi-day virtual event targeting students,
engineers and researchers developing HPC open-source software.
It aims at helping teams of one to six developers improve the build
scripts of codes they develop.
The supported build systems for this Hackathon are Autotools and
CMake.

* Prerequisites

Participants are expected to come with a code they develop.
They should agree to share their source code with all the other
participants. Therefore a an open-source license (GPL, BSD, MIT,
...) is required.
This event will take place with Zoom, and a Slack space will be used
for communicating between teams.

* Event format

The TREX Build System Hackathon will be hosted online with all times
Central European Summer Time (CEST). Teams will be assigned to virtual
breakout rooms to work on their codes and will present their progress
to all participants in the main virtual meeting space.

* Registration

Registration is free.
All team members should register for the event.
