* Presentation
  
Making HPC software easy to install on multiple supercomputers or
different architectures is a difficult task: different systems have
different compilers, libraries, system commands etc. This task can be
helped by tools like CMake and GNU Autotools.

In this Hackathon, we will help code developers better understand
how to use these build systems to improve the portability of their
applications. In addition, well-done configuration scripts facilitate
the packaging of the software, and presentations will be given to
propose different packaging possibilities to distribute the software.

This Hackathon will take place as a virtual event from 8 to 12 July,
and is targeting students/researchers developing HPC open-source
software.

* Prerequisites

Participants are expected to come with a code for which they want to
create or improve installation scripts. The supported build systems for this
Hackathon are Autotools and CMake.
Participants should agree to share their source code with all the
other participants. Therefore a an open-source license (GPL, BSD, MIT,
...) is required.
This event will take place with Zoom, and a Slack space will be used
for communicating between teams.
