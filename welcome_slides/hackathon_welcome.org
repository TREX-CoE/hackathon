* Welcome

  
** Objective

   - Understand how the CMake and GNU Autotools build systems work
   - Improve the way you distribute your software

** Why?

   - When you can't use your own software on a new machine, you are frustated
   - When users download your software and are not able to
     install it, they look for another one
   - If they really need that software, they will you bother you
     asking for help
   - Once set up, it will save you a lot of day in every day development

** Important

   We don't support the Windows OS in this hackathon.

  
* Beginning of the week
   
** Presentations
   
   - Short intro to CMake (Radovan Bast) and Autotools (Christian Feld): you will
     start to decide which one you prefer using for your project.
   - Longer tutorials on CMake (Radovan) and Autotools (Evgeny,
     Anthony) to confirm your choice and to start to diving into it.

* Middle of the week

** Work on your own code

   - Improve your Makefiles
   - Introduce/improve your CMake/Autotools scripts
   - Ask plenty questions to us or other participants
   - During hands-on sessions, work as you prefer: take breaks when
     you want, etc. It is a moment where we are available for questions.

* How to interact with us

   - You will be separated in break-out rooms, one for each team.
   - Those who are alone in their team can join in a common room

  #+LATEX: \end{block}
  #+LATEX: \begin{block}{Slack}

   - The Zoom chat will be disabled.
   - All written/chat communication should be done via Slack
   - You can use Slack to communicate asynchronously with helpers that are not on Zoom

* You participation
  
** We expect you to
   - Present your code and how it is installed.
     It should not be optimal, otherwise you would not be here! Don't
     be shy!
   - Present to others in detail the progress you made for your code,
     sharing with others tips and tricks, useful links on the web etc
   - /Code-swapping/: Take the code of other teams, try to install it
     on some of your machines and give some feedback

** Note
   Don't spend too much time preparing a nice presentation. You can
   improvise sharing your screen and showing things live.
   
* End of the week
   
** Presentations
   
   Now your software can build, how to go beyond:
   - HPC Containers (Kai Löhnig)
   - Guix-HPC (Ludovic Courtès)
   - Conda (Leopold Talirz)
   - Spack (Todd Gamblin)
