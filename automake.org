This page contains tutorial on the usage

part of the Autotools tutorial.

* Introduction

* Making Makefiles portable

The most popular implementation of =make= is =GNU Make=. =GNU Make= is much more
evolved than the POSIX standard, so Makefiles designed for =GNU Make= are not
guaranteed to work with alternate implementations of =make=, such as BSD make for
instance. If you want your software to be /really/ portable, you should stick to the
POSIX standard in your =Makefile= by including the line
#BEGIN_SRC makefile
.POSIX
#END_SRC
at the top of your =Makefile=.

** What you will lose by sticking to the POSIX standard

- Pattern rules, such as

  #BEGIN_SRC makefile
  %_test.o: %_test.c
          $(CC) $< -o $@
  #END_SRC

- Special functions ~$(wildcard *.c)~, ~$(patsubst %.f, %.o, $(SRC))~, ...

** Rules that will make everything simpler

- Use ~/bin/sh~ instead of ~/bin/bash~
- Don't put your compiled files (=.o=) in a separate location than the source files
- Give up writing your =Makefiles= by hand. Write *scripts* (Bash, Python) to
  write them for you.
- Install =bmake= as an alternative to =GNU make= to check the portability of
  your =Makefiles=.
